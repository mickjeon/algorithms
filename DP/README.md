# Dynamic Programming

## Why is it important?
- DP can reduce the complexity of a problem by memoizing repeated cases
- DP is useful when looking for min, max, number of ways, etc

## 1-D DP
### Strategies
1. Take vs. Don't take
2. Incontinuous --> Continuous
3. Bitwise DP; use the fact that left shift by 1 is multiplication of 2
